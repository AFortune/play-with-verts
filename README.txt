# play-with-verts

The code we have been writing on the stream.

I've added a few comments so it's not exactly the same, but close enough.

## Getting Started

- `(ql:quickload :play-with-verts)`
- `(in-package :play-with-verts)`
- `(play :start)`

## Warning on Dependencies

If you are new to lisp I recommend waiting a few weeks until the next quicklisp release, then all the code you are seeing will be available through quicklisp and should just work.
